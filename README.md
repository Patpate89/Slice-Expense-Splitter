## Getting Started with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS

This project is set up using React and Vite to provide a minimal configuration for a smooth development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules. We are also using **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first CSS framework, to streamline styling and ensure a responsive, modern UI.

### Tools Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Development environment for fast builds and smooth HMR.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Build the project for production: `npm run build`

Feel free to customize this setup according to your project needs.

## Tailwind CSS Integration

Weâ€™ve integrated Tailwind CSS for efficient and customizable styling. You can start using the utility classes provided by Tailwind in your React components right away. For more information on how to use Tailwind, check the [official documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

To modify the Tailwind configuration, edit the `tailwind.config.js` file located at the root of the project.
